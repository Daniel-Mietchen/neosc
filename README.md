This repo assists the project [nanopublication-Enhanced Open Science Communication (nEOSC)](https://knowledgepixels.com/incubator.html), which explores the use of nanopublications across the research landscape and all around the research cycle. Nanopublications are a way to express small units of knowledge in a machine-readable way that is formatted compatibly with standard knowledge graphs. While many comparably small units of knowledge are largely discipline-specific (e.g. a messenger RNA, a musical motif, a lexeme, a chemical bond or a mathematical lemma), suitably designed sets of nanopublications can be used both within and across domains of knowledge.
