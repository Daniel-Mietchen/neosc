In this file, use cases for [nanopublications](https://nanopub.net/) in scholarly contexts are being collected.

# Conveying assumptions

e.g. the conditions under which the reached conclusions are expected to be valid

# Conveying changes

* see dedicated ticket at https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1804 .
* see also https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton/issues/74 for reviewing changes of datasets
* see also https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanodash/issues/234 for documenting changes of nanopublication query results
* curation events, e.g. in author disambiguation
* policy changes

# Conveying gratitude

* see dedicated ticket at https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1800 .

# Conveying intentions

e.g. the intent to
- participate in an event
- perform research of a certain kind (this is relevant, e.g., in the contexts of research funding, general research resource allocation and ethical review)
- allow certain kinds of uses for a resource, e.g. as per
  - copyright licenses
    - see https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1803 for expressing the licensing of a given resource
    - see https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1805 for defining a default license for (future) nanopublications published by a specific user 
  - Digital Use Conditions
    - see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03280-6 for background

# Conveying methodological details

- e.g. the use of specific chemicals, theorems or software packages
- see also https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/explore?0&id=RAYgUwjV570tqZLNNsBuIoVtQ0lwy_GNpzDzSZVv36dzo for expressing CiTO relations between an article and a digital object
- see also theorem provers like LEAN
- see also hypothesis descriptions as in https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e119805

# Conveying observations

- e.g. sensor values, current legal situation

# Conveying replication attempts

- especially computational ones, e.g. as per https://doi.org/10.4230/TGDK.2.2.4

# Conveying results

- e.g. measurement values, or whether a theorem was proven

# Defining crosswalks

- crosswalks between nanopublications and Wikidata/ Wikibase edits 
- crosswalks between nanopublications and git commits 
- crosswalks between nanopublications and ActivityPub 
- crosswalks between nanopublications and proof assistant tactics 

# Participatory science

- e.g. "online quantum contributions" as per https://doi.org/10.1016%2FJ.TREE.2011.10.010

# Reporting bugs
