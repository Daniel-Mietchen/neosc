# Conveying intentions

e.g. the intent to
- participate in an event
- perform research of a certain kind (this is relevant, e.g., in the contexts of research funding, general research resource allocation and ethical review)
- allow certain kinds of uses for a resource, e.g. as per
  - copyright licenses
    - see https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1803 for expressing the licensing of a given resource
    - see https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1805 for defining a default license for (future) nanopublications published by a specific user 
  - Digital Use Conditions
    - see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03280-6 for background

# Conveying methodological details

- e.g. the use of specific chemicals, theorems or software packages
- see also https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/explore?0&id=RAYgUwjV570tqZLNNsBuIoVtQ0lwy_GNpzDzSZVv36dzo for expressing CiTO relations between an article and a digital object  

# Conveying results

- e.g. measurement values, or whether a theorem was proven
